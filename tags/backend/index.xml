      <description>Disclaimer: During this time I researched in my free-time, as individual opensource contributor and citzen how to deal and implement rate-limiting in golang, for a gRPC server. This lines represent my own thoughts, and efforts and research for improving myself and researchs as individual.
P.S: I thanks the #thanos opensource community for support in this research, which I initially picked up and started from my own initiative for researching on an upstream issue, and which I&amp;rsquo;m not yet finished to do :) https://github.</description>
