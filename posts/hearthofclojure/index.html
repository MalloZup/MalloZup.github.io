        <p>A courageous and adventurous conference?</p>

<p>In the train to Belgium,  I was asking me: <code>What is to be a developer?</code> I&rsquo;m a remote developer but during the years, my answer to this question has always changed;
like when you revisit a city in different times of your life.</p>

<p>With a superficial mindset, people might think that a developer is just a person who write code, and our industry it might push people to think like this.</p>

<p>The conference Hearth of Clojure perhaps was trying to answer this question with a deep perspective.
There were different talks from various domains regarding green-IT, free software communities, music, art, mathematic, esthetic,  design and .. Clojure and functional things for sure :)
It might be that code isn&rsquo;t just coding.
Coding is an human activity intereconnetcted with differents domains and people emotions from different cultures. Coding is an approach to life.
Coding is also the art of coding, individual creativity and thinking, we should not forget this, I see also an opposite trend in our industry :)</p>

<p>I appreciate during some lightning talks, the courage of some people who spoke about often unspoken problems, e.g: depressions in IT, or what is our relationship or how we deal with our body as programmers? Other questions arised during the conference.</p>

<p>Time just flowed naturally, it was not hectic. We had enough pauses, after each talk were we could comment with others, and we shared a unique room, no parallelism involved :).</p>

<p>All this small details, thanks to the organisation has build a friendly athomsphere for stranger coming around the world.
I have also appreciated the fact that we are trying to give an europeean athomsphere and culture to conference happening in Europe, and not just imitating some others models, which perhaps are great elsewhere but doesn&rsquo;t fit in Europe with is own identity.
( Btw, this is also why I appreciate Clojure language and community for their courage to be non-conventional with perhaps other models?)</p>

<p>I personally had the chance to talk in person with so many great developers, not only from skill level but also from human values:  unsophisticated, open and authentic.</p>

<p>I enjoyed also the way we spoke about things in general; listen each others with a genuine interest. ( this isn&rsquo;t always granted, especially in our tech world)</p>

<p>I will not mention all the names of people I have met and discussed with, because either I will forget some of them and also putting some well known names or stating their X company, create from my perspective a phenomenon like society of spectacle in IT, which i&rsquo;m not a fun.</p>

<p>The Heart of Clojure conference was a real alternative and human warm conference.
Perhaps some of us think that free software and or opensource are the same thing, and they are obvious and something well known.
Everybody speak about it, and we know its dynamics already, right?</p>

<p>In fact, I think lot of people share the same doubts with me about free software and its meaning for individuals and contributors. There are lot of open questions, which find different answer in different countries and communities perhaps.</p>

<p>The most common error we can do is thinking we known already our world because we have some experience or we think we have? :).</p>

<p>We shape the reality and codebases with some design patterns or models we take as granted. Think about objects :D</p>

<p>Definitely beeing part of Hearth of Clojure was for me an event with great resonance, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to continue things and collaborating with the clojurians out there.</p>
